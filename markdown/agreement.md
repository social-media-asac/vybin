## Conflict Plan
As we are working as a team conflicts between team members might happen, we agreed that all of us should discuss the conflict and we have listen to each other and respect each other point of view.
We as a team going to split the tasks between each other we already assigned a major task for each member so everyone have to work and participate, if any one is not working effectively the all team work will be effected.
If a member of our team is not working efficiently we will talk to him and the reasons, and help to solve these issues to work efficiently, however if the member is not responding at all we will report the issue to the instructor.
## Communication Plan
Our main communication portal for emailing each other will be slack, and Zoom is the main communication channel for our meetings.
We will have meetings every morning, and we will have a time for each member to share his ideas with the team.
To create a comfort atmosphere we will vote for any idea or decision we are going to take in our project.
## Work Plan
To follow up the project progress and to assign daily tasks for the team members we will have a daily meeting that will discuss the previous tasks so all the team will be updated and we will assign new tasks for each member. 
Trello is the main project management tool that we will use during our work.
